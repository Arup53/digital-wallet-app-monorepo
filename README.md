# What is xPay

A mini-scale digital wallet, similar to Apple Pay or PayPal, that simulates peer-to-peer fund transfers and wallet top-ups from a bank.

## Features

- `Bank Transfer`: Individual users can transfer money from their bank to their wallet.
- `p2p Transfer`: For non-merchant users, peer-to-peer transfers are implemented with protection against concurrent transaction misuse.
- `Transcation History`: Users can view all their transactions, whether payments or transfers, through a dedicated history interface.
- `CI-CD pipeline`: Build a ci cd pipeline for aws deployment.


## Architectures 


### General Architecture
![On-Ramp](./apps/docs/images/general.png)

The figure-1 above represents main system architecture which is separated to two parts â€“ apps or frontends, backend system- consists of a server ,webhook and a PostgreSQL db cloud instance.

### On-Ramp Architecture
![On-Ramp](./apps/docs/images/onramp.png)

For, figure-2 represents on ramp or simply bank to wallet transfer transaction. Users apps fund transfer request is goes to backend server that talks to both db and desired bank. After, sending the request of frontend the server primarily update the transaction as processing ; when the bank finally sends response ,either success or failure,  it goes to webhook server that will push it to the main server, and update the specific db transaction status.

### p2p transfer

For, peer to peer transfer between to two users both need to be register with the xPay systems.
